My emacs config.

Setup
=====

This repo is prepared to live side by side with the other files in your emacs.d
directory and should be cloned inside that directory:

```
cd ~/.emacs.d
git clone git@github.com:/jimmyppi/emacs.d .
```

You must also remove the .emacs file in your home directory because emacs
will look for that file before emacs.d/init.el that is used by this setup.
